# Updated UI Flow for Group Membership

## 🎯 **New Features Added**

### 1. **Check Membership Again Button**
- Appears when user is **NOT** part of the group (`isMemberOfGroup === false`)
- Allows users to manually recheck their membership status
- Useful when users get added to the group after initial check

### 2. **Try Again Button**
- Appears when membership check **FAILS** (`isMemberOfGroup === null`)
- Allows users to retry the membership check if there was an error
- Helps with network issues or temporary failures

## 📱 **Complete UI States**

### State 1: **Loading** (`isCheckingMembership === true`)
```
🔵 Checking group membership...
```

### State 2: **Member Found** (`isMemberOfGroup === true`)
```
✅ You are a member of the group
🟣 Continue with voting
[Voting Interface]
```

### State 3: **Not a Member** (`isMemberOfGroup === false`)
```
❌ You are not part of the group

Contact the group admin to be added to the group.
Once added, click the button below to refresh your status.

[Check Membership Again] (Blue Button)
```

### State 4: **Check Failed** (`isMemberOfGroup === null`)
```
🟡 Unable to check group membership

[Try Again] (Blue Button)
```

## 🔄 **User Flow Examples**

### Scenario 1: User Gets Added to Group
1. User logs in → Shows "You are not part of the group"
2. Admin adds user to group via blockchain explorer
3. User clicks "Check Membership Again"
4. UI updates to show "✅ You are a member of the group"
5. Voting interface becomes available

### Scenario 2: Network Error Recovery
1. User logs in → Network error occurs
2. Shows "Unable to check group membership"
3. User clicks "Try Again"
4. Membership check succeeds
5. Shows appropriate member/non-member status

## 🎨 **Button Styling**

- **Check Membership Again**: Blue button with loading state
- **Try Again**: Blue button with loading state
- Both buttons are disabled while `isCheckingMembership` is true
- Loading spinner appears during check

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

```typescript
// Both buttons call the same function
handleRegister={checkGroupMembership}

// Button states
isLoading={isCheckingMembership}
disabled={isCheckingMembership}
```

## ✅ **Benefits**

1. **Better UX**: Users can refresh their status without page reload
2. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback when membership changes
3. **Error Recovery**: Users can retry failed checks
4. **Clear Guidance**: Instructions on what to do if not a member
5. **Responsive**: Works with the existing loading states
